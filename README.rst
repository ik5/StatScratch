StatScratch
============
The following project is an attempt to scratch an itch of mine:
  - Creating static web site, 
  - Providing dynamic and static routes 
  - Control the difference between draft to check and published materials
  - Working with different structured markups, based on file, rather then 
    project
  - Multilingual support
  - Multiple template support
  - Inline and general configuration for the project

All of the existed static generators are either to specific for a task 
(blogs for example), or too complex to master, for small web sites.

So I have an itch, and this is my scratch
